# Fklink

`fklink.sh` is a Bash script designed to generate a short link that logs and gets informations about the IP address of anyone who clicks on it. The script also sets up a local PHP server and a Cloudflare tunnel to make the link accessible over the internet.

## Features

- **PHP server**: Hosts a simple PHP script to log IP addresses of visitors.
- **Cloudflare tunnel**: Exposes the local PHP server to the internet through a secure Cloudflare tunnel.
- **IP logging**: Logs the IP address of each visitor and provides detailed information about the IP.
- **Custom redirect URL**: Allows you to specify a URL that visitors will be redirected to after their IP address is logged.

## Requirements

- Linux environment with Bash shell.
- `jq` for JSON parsing (the script will install it if not present).
- `curl` and `tar` for downloading and extracting files.
- `php` for running the PHP server.
- `cloudflared` (the script will download the appropriate binary if it is not already installed).

## Usage

1. **Make the script executable**:
    ```bash
    chmod +x fklink.sh
    ```

2. **Run the script**:
    ```bash
    ./fklink.sh
    ```

3. **Follow the prompts**:
   - Enter a valid URL when prompted. The URL should be the destination where users will be redirected after their IP is logged.

4. **Share the generated link**:
   - The script will generate a short link. Share this link with people. Each time the link is accessed, the visitor's IP address will be logged.

5. **View logged IPs**:
   - The script will continuously monitor and display logged IP addresses along with detailed information.
